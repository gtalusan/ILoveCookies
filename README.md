ILoveCookies
============

Safari Extension to block paywall cookies for Toronto-area newspapers such as Toronto Star, Toronto Sun
and The Globe and Mail.

Installation
============

Download [the extension](https://github.com/gtalusan/ILoveCookies/raw/master/ILoveCookies.safariextz).  Find it in Finder, double click and
allow it to install into Safari.

Source Code
===========

Look in ILoveCookies.safariextension.

How It Works
============

It will inject a hook after document load and remove any bad cookies.  The list of sites is hardcoded.

I'm lazy and want to read the news instead.
